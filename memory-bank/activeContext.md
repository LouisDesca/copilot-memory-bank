# Active Context: Copilot Memory Bank

## Current Work Focus

*   System and documentation setup is complete.
*   Apache 2.0 license compliance (as a derivative/fork) is now in place.
*   LICENSE and NOTICE files are present in the root directory for compliance with the upstream license.
*   The `README.md` now provides a comprehensive guide for developers.
*   The Copilot Memory Bank is ready for real-world use and testing.
*   Next focus: testing Copilot's context awareness and refining documentation as needed.
*   Potentially creating example `*.prompt.md` files.

## Recent Changes

*   LICENSE file with full Apache 2.0 license text added for compliance with upstream (not as a re-licensing).
*   Empty NOTICE file created in the root directory for compliance.
*   Updated `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` and `.clinerules` to clarify compliance-only status.
*   Removed Apache 2.0 license header from `README.md` (repo is not asserting its own license).
*   Created and refined all core Memory Bank files.
*   Completed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with detailed Cline-inspired instructions and workflow summary.
*   Created and then transformed workflow documentation into a developer-focused `README.md` in the project root.
*   Updated references and best practices throughout documentation.

## Next Steps

1.  Test the Copilot Memory Bank system in real development scenarios.
2.  Refine `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `README.md` based on feedback and observed Copilot behavior.
3.  Create example `*.prompt.md` files if advanced prompt workflows are needed.
4.  Continue to keep `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` up to date after significant changes.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   How to best test Copilot's adherence to the Memory Bank context in practice.
*   When and how to introduce prompt files for advanced use cases.
*   Ensuring all team members understand and follow the updated documentation.
