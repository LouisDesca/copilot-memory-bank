# Progress: Copilot Memory Bank

## What Works

*   The core concept and project goals are defined in `project-brief.md`.
*   The initial structure of the `memory-bank/` directory is established.
*   The foundational context files (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created with initial content.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **Workflows & Documentation**: Clear guidelines on how to initialize, use, and maintain the Copilot Memory Bank system need to be written.
2.  **Testing & Refinement**: The system needs to be tested in practice to see how well Copilot utilizes the provided context via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and refine the instructions/structure as needed.
3.  **Example Prompt Files (`*.prompt.md`)**: Creating examples to showcase task-specific context usage (Exploratory/Optional based on brief).

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Initial Setup Complete / Ready for Testing & Documentation.
*   The basic file structure for the memory bank is in place.
*   The initial `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file has been created, linking Copilot to the `memory-bank/` structure.
*   The next steps involve documenting workflows and testing the effectiveness of the instructions.

## Known Issues

*   The effectiveness of the current `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in guiding Copilot to use the `memory-bank/` context needs practical testing.
*   Potential limitations of `copilot-instructions.md` (length, complexity, file referencing) still need to be evaluated through use.
