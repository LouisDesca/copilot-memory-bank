# Progress: Copilot Memory Bank

## What Works

*   All core Memory Bank files are created and refined.
*   `.github/copilot-instructions.md` provides detailed, Cline-inspired instructions and workflow summary for Copilot.
*   The developer-focused `README.md` in the project root explains setup, usage, and best practices.
*   The system is fully documented and ready for real-world use and testing.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **Testing & Refinement:** Test the Copilot Memory Bank system in real development scenarios. Refine `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `README.md` based on feedback and observed Copilot behavior.
2.  **Example Prompt Files (`*.prompt.md`):** Create examples to showcase advanced, task-specific context usage (optional/exploratory).

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Documentation & System Setup Complete / Ready for Testing.
*   The Memory Bank structure and all documentation are in place.
*   The next step is to test Copilot's context awareness and refine the system as needed.

## Known Issues

*   The effectiveness of `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in guiding Copilot to use the `memory-bank/` context needs practical testing.
*   Potential limitations of Copilot's context window, file referencing, or instruction complexity may be discovered during use.
