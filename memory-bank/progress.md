# Progress: Copilot Memory Bank

## What Works

*   The core concept and project goals are defined in `project-brief.md`.
*   The initial structure of the `memory-bank/` directory is established.
*   The foundational context files (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created with initial content.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: This crucial file needs to be created and populated with instructions directing Copilot to use the `memory-bank/` context. Its effectiveness needs testing.
2.  **Workflows & Documentation**: Clear guidelines on how to initialize, use, and maintain the Copilot Memory Bank system need to be written.
3.  **Example Prompt Files (`*.prompt.md`)**: Creating examples to showcase task-specific context usage (Exploratory/Optional based on brief).
4.  **Testing & Refinement**: The system needs to be tested in practice to see how well Copilot utilizes the provided context and refine the instructions/structure as needed.

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Initialization / Setup.
*   The basic file structure for the memory bank is in place.
*   The next critical step is creating the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to link Copilot to this structure.

## Known Issues

*   None identified yet, as the core integration (`copilot-instructions.md`) has not been implemented or tested.
*   Potential limitations of `copilot-instructions.md` regarding length, complexity, and referencing external files are anticipated but not yet confirmed.
