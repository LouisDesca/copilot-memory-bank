# Progress: Copilot Memory Bank

## What Works

*   All core Memory Bank files are created and refined.
*   LICENSE file with full Apache 2.0 license text is present in the root directory for compliance with the upstream license (this repo is not re-licensed).
*   Empty NOTICE file is present in the root directory for compliance.
*   `.clinerules` file is present in the root directory, tracking compliance and project intelligence.
*   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` foundational file is present and clarifies compliance-only status.
*   `.github/copilot-instructions.md` has been refined to specify that Copilot should read memory bank files at the beginning of each new chat session (not for every request).
*   The developer-focused `README.md` has been updated to clarify that memory bank file creation/verification is for human developers, not for Copilot.
*   The system is fully documented and operational for real-world use and testing.
*   Alternative setup using VS Code settings.json has been added for developers who prefer not to store instructions in the repository.
*   A `memory-bank-settings.json` template file has been created to help developers implement the Memory Bank using VS Code settings.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **Testing & Refinement:** Test the Copilot Memory Bank system with the refined instructions in real development scenarios. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the modified instructions.
2.  **Example Prompt Files (`*.prompt.md`):** Create examples to showcase advanced, task-specific context usage (optional/exploratory).
3.  **Potential UX Improvements:** Based on testing results, identify and implement any usability improvements to make the Memory Bank system more intuitive for both humans and Copilot.
4.  **Evaluate Settings.json Approach:** Gather feedback on the effectiveness of the settings.json alternative compared to the repository-based approach.

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** System Operational with Enhanced Flexibility / Ready for Extended Testing
*   The Memory Bank structure, all documentation, and compliance files are in place.
*   Instructions have been refined to improve Copilot's context handling behavior.
*   The system now supports both repository-based and settings.json-based implementation approaches.
*   The system is ready for extended testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the updated instructions and alternative setup options.

## Known Issues

*   The effectiveness of the updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in guiding Copilot to read memory bank files at the right time needs evaluation.
*   Potential limitations of Copilot's context window, file referencing, or instruction complexity may be discovered during extended use.
*   The balance between comprehensive context and instruction efficiency may need further optimization based on testing results.
*   The settings.json implementation may have different behavior than the repository-based approach, which needs to be verified and documented.
